# MoreMap

A mod for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk that adds pins to the map for each type of collectible, unlockable characters, and Polo photo spots.

Each type of pin can be toggled on or off in the new phone app.

Pin colors can be customized.

By default, requires the map collectible to be found before working, but can be changed in the config.
