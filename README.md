# MoreMap

A mod for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk that adds pins to the map for each type of collectible, unlockable characters, and Polo photo spots.

Each type of pin can be toggled on or off in the new phone app.

Pin colors can be customized.

By default, requires the map collectible to be found before working, but can be changed in the config.


Install the mod via [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/bomb-rush-cyberfunk/p/TRPG/MoreMap/), or by following the steps below:

1. Download and install [BepInEx 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) in your Bomb Rush Cyberfunk root folder. *Do not use any pre-release versions of BepInEx 6.*

2. Start Bomb Rush Cyberfunk once so that BepInEx can create its required configuration files.

3. Download `MoreMap.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/TRPG0/BRC-MoreMap/releases) page and put it into `BepInEx\plugins`.
